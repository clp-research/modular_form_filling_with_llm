Its development process involved extensive research, brainstorming, designing, field tests, and refinement. Collaboration with marine biologists, engineers, and fellow fishermen played a crucial role in its creation. The invention aims to effectively catch multiple species while minimizing bycatch and reducing impact on marine ecosystem. It features a unique combination of materials and mesh sizes, as well as a sensor system that detects the presence of non-target species and triggers a release mechanism. Currently, the Multi-Catch Net System is being used by fishermen along the west coast of the USA and has contributed to more sustainable fishing methods by improving efficiency."}, "Have working prototypes, product apparatus or compositions, etc. been made and tested?": {"type": "single-choice", "required": true, "answer": "yes", "options": ["yes", "no"]}, "Give a detailed description of the Invention": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "new type of soccer cleat for female players"}, "Describe the particular problem the invention seeks to solve": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "discomfort and lack of support in existing cleats"}, "What existing technologies or products solve or attempt to solve the same or similar problems?": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "Several existing technologies attempt to solve the same or similar problems, but they often face limitations in efficiency, cost, or accessibility.
