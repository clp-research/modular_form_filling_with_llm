One example is the use of advanced imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computed tomography (CT), which provide detailed images of the brain to help surgeons plan and navigate during surgical procedures. Another example is the use of robotic surgery systems, which offer greater precision and control during delicate operations.; ; In comparison to these existing technologies, the proposed solution offers a unique combination of advanced imaging, robotic precision, and real-time feedback, allowing for even more accurate and safer surgical procedures. By integrating these features, the proposed solution aims to improve surgical outcomes and reduce the risk of complications for patients undergoing brain surgery.", "title": "Smart Wallet", "category": "Financial Technology (FinTech) and Personal Finance Management tools", "advantage 1": "targeted and sustainable fishing practices", "advantage 2": "biodegradable material", "commercial application 1": "commercial fishermen", "commercial application 2": "recreational fishermen", "commercial application 3": "research institutions", "commercial application 4": "conservation organizations", "future potential use 1": "integration with advanced data analysis and tracking systems", "future potential use 2": "adapted for use in aquaculture", "unique features": "efficiently harness and store energy from multiple sources, including solar, wind, and kinetic energy", "benefits": "reduces reliance on traditional power sources, ensures continuous and sustainable supply of energy, even in remote or off-grid locations", "design": "compact", "interface": "user-friendly", "applications": "powering small electronic devices, providing backup power for homes and businesses", "categories": "Home Appliances, Energy Efficiency", "date conceived": "September 15, 2021", "origin": "passion for beetroot farming and experience in an office job", "development process": "extensive research, feedback gathering, and collaboration with experts", "purpose": "increase crop yields and profitability for farmers", "occupation": "beetroot farmer", "research plans": "conducting extensive field tests, gathering data, and analyzing the results", "scheduling": "during the growing season", "funding options": "commercial sponsorship or federal grants", "goal": "create a sustainable and efficient solution for beetroot farming"}
