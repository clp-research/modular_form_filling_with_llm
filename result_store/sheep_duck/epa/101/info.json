The incident occurred near the outskirts of the university campus, specifically in the vicinity of the intersection between Greenbelt Drive and Wetland Lane. The violation involves the improper disposal of hazardous waste materials contained in large drums. These drums were found to contain toxic chemicals and industrial byproducts, which pose a significant threat to the local ecosystem and wildlife. The perpetrators are believed to have intentionally dumped these drums in the wetland area to avoid proper waste disposal procedures and associated costs. It is crucial to address this environmental violation promptly to minimize the potential harm to the wetland ecosystem and to hold the responsible parties accountable for their actions."}
