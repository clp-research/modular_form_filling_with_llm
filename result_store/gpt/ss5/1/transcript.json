The following \nmodules are available to you:\n\n1. form_chunks: group questions into chunks, only call this once, reforming the chunks has no effect. \n2. fill_chunk: work on a chunk on the form and fill out its fields. \n3. stop: Stops the process and returns the form.\n\nSpecify what action needs to be taken next based on the current state. \nIf the \"fill_chunk\" module is to be taken, also specify what chunk needs to \nbe worked on. If chunks have not been formed yet, start by calling form_chunks. \nIf they have been formed, choose a chunk to work on and call fill_chunk. \nStop once all chunks have been varified.\nOnly fill out the Return form. Do not give a reasoning for your answer.\n\nRETURN  FORM:\n{\"next action\": null, \"chunk to work on\": null}\n\nCURRENT STATE:\n{\"chunks\": {\"Group 1 1\": \"validated\", \"Group 1 2\": \"validated\", \"Group 2 1\": \"validated\", \"Group 2 2\": \"validated\", \"Group 3\": \"validated\", \"Group 4\": \"validated\", \"Group 5\": \"validated\"}, \"last action\": [\"fill_chunk\", \"fill_chunk\", \"fill_chunk\", \"fill_chunk\", \"fill_chunk\", \"fill_chunk\"]} ", "output": "{\"next action\": \"stop\", \"chunk to work on\": null}"}]}
