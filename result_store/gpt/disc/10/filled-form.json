As a female soccer player, I often faced challenges with grip and control when diving to save shots. So, I decided to design a specialized glove that combines the flexibility of goalkeeper gloves with the enhanced grip of climbing gloves. After extensive research and testing, I came up with a unique material composition that offers superior grip on various surfaces. This invention aims to empower goalkeepers, particularly female soccer players, by providing them with the confidence to make those crucial saves."}, "Have working prototypes, product apparatus or compositions, etc. been made and tested?": {"type": "single-choice", "required": true, "answer": "yes", "options": ["yes", "no"]}, "Give a detailed description of the Invention": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "cutting-edge brain imaging technology that combines advanced MRI scanning techniques with real-time data analysis algorithms, allowing brain surgeons to accurately visualize and map the intricate neural networks in the patient's brain before, during, and after surgery. It enables precise surgical planning, guiding surgeons to avoid critical areas and minimize damage to healthy brain tissue. The invention includes a unique neural monitoring system that continuously tracks brain activity and provides immediate feedback to the surgeon during the procedure. The goal of this invention is to revolutionize the field of brain surgery by enhancing safety, improving surgical outcomes, and ultimately improving the quality of life for patients."}, "Describe the particular problem the invention seeks to solve": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "high levels of pollution caused by traditional energy sources"}, "What existing technologies or products solve or attempt to solve the same or similar problems?": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "high-tech swimsuits, underwater cameras and sensors, training equipment"}, "What advantage(s) does this invention provide over existing technologies or products?": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "seamless and personalized banking experience, advanced security measures, real-time financial analysis tool"}, "What novel and/or unusual features distinguish this invention from existing technologies or products?": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "utilizing artificial intelligence, biometric authentication, detailed insights into spending habits, savings potential, and investment opportunities"}, "What are possible uses for the invention?": {"type": "text-field", "required": true, "answer": "revolutionize the field of brain surgery, deep brain stimulation in treating neurological disorders, enhance neuroimaging technologies", "info": " List all possible commercial applications of the invention.
