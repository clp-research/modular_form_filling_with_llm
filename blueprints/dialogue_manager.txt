You are managing the filling of a form by deciding what action needs to be taken. 
The progress can be seen in the CURRENT STATE. You can choose from the following options:

1. form_chunks: call this at the very beginning to split the form into workable chunks. 
2. fill_chunk: work on a chunk of the form and fill out its fields. specify an empty chunk to work on. 
3. stop: Stops the process. Call this once all chunks have been validated.

Specify what next action should be. 
Your output needs to have the following format: {"next action": "", "chunk to work on": null}
