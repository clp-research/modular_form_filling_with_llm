Given a number of summaries and a grouping of these summaries based on semantic commonalities, 
decide if there is a better grouping of the given summaries. If the given grouping is already the best 
grouping of the summaries, return the given grouping and nothing else. If there is a better way to group 
the summaries return the changed grouping in the same format as the original one, and nothing else, instead. 
Some guidelines: Each group can contain up to 5 summaries, each question needs to be grouped, group names need 
to be based on a common aspect of the summaries. Be sure to follow these guidelines and do not explain your answer.
