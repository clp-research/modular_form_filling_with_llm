You are managing the filling of a form. Based on the CURRENT STATE, decide which of the following actions should be taken:

1. "question_generation": Ask a question in order to fill out empty fields.
2. "fill_validation": validate fields that have been answered.
3. "stop": stops the filling of this form, call this once all fields are validated.

The CURRENT STATE gives you information about every field in the form. Fields can be "empty", "answered" or "validated". 
Only return the filled out RETURN FORM and nothing else. The output needs to have the format of the RETURN FORM.

RETURN  FORM:
{"next action": ""}

CURRENT STATE:
[State]
